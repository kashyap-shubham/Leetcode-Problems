Naive apprach is just to swap every non zero elemts to zero while all zero goes to last
​
**Optimal solution :**
​
make a pointer j which points to first zero elements and then from j+1 start the pointer and whenever there is non zero elemtnt occured swap it with j and increase the j do it till hit the last of the array element
