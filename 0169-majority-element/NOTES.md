**Approach 1 :**
sort the element since majority elements always exits so when we sort the elements whaterver elments comes after n/2 position is majority elements because majority has to be by n/2 times so all no major elemnts comes upto n/2 places after that whatever has come it must be majortity but the thing is it require O(nlogn) tc.
