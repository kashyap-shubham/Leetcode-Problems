# **solution 1 :**
traverse the linked list and get the value, store it as string then while traversing reverse the list and again traverse the list and get the value compare the fist value and second value if it is same then it is a palindorme; another approach would be don't reverse the linked list just traver and get the value and reverse the value and then compare,
​
# **solution 2 :**
this is better approach
go to middle element and then reverse the fist half and compare the elements of each part if it is same then palindrome else not.
