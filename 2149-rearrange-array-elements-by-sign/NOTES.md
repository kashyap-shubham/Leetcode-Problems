# Approach 1:
iterate through a array and make two sub array one consist of positive intergers and anther consists of negative integer it will take O(n) time and o(n/2) + O(n/2) space complexity for postive and negative integers and then after iterate through a loop and take each value form positive and negative array and put the values consequetively it will take O(n) time again
so total t.c = O(n) + O(n) = O(n)
s.c = O(n) + O(n) = O(n)
